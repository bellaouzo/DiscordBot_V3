## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to launch your own bot? Here‚Äôs how to get it running.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

*   [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 or higher).
*   A **Discord Account** and a server where you have admin rights.
*   A **Git client** (or you can download the code as a ZIP).

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Get the Code:**
    Open your terminal and run this command:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd discord-bot-v3
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This command downloads all the necessary libraries the bot needs to work.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Your Bot:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the project's root folder. This file will hold your bot's secrets.

    > **Important:** Never share the contents of this file with anyone!

    Copy and paste the following into your `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual bot information:
    ```env
    # You can get these from the Discord Developer Portal
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
    CLIENT_ID=your_bot_client_id_here
    GUILD_ID=your_server_id_here
    ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot

You have two options for running the bot:

*   **For Developers (`dev` mode):**
    This mode automatically restarts the bot when you change the code. Perfect for when you're adding new features!
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

*   **For Everyday Use (`start` mode):**
    This runs the bot in a stable mode, ready to serve your community.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```

## üß© Adding New Commands

Adding your own custom commands is super simple.

1.  **Create a Command File:**
    In the `src/commands/` folder, create a new file. Let's call it `hello.ts`.

2.  **Write the Command Code:**
    Here's a simple "hello" command. Paste this into your `hello.ts` file:
    ```typescript
    import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';

    // Command metadata
    export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
        .setName('hello')
        .setDescription('Replies with Hello!');

    // The function that runs when the command is used
    export async function execute(interaction) {
        await interaction.reply('Hello!');
    }
    ```

3.  **Register Your Command:**
    Open `src/commands/index.ts` and add a line to export your new command:
    ```typescript
    export * as ping from './ping';
    export * as hello from './hello'; // Add this line!
    ```
    The bot will automatically pick it up. That's it!
